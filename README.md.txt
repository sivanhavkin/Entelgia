# Entelgia

**Entelgia** is a psychologically-inspired multi-agent AI architecture
designed to explore persistent identity, emotional regulation,
and self-aware dialogue.

## What this is
- A single-file runnable system (`entelgia_unified.py`)
- Two agents (Socrates & Athena) with evolving internal state
- Persistent memory and Freud-inspired conflict dynamics
- An Observer (Fixy) that detects loops and injects corrective perspective shifts

## What this is NOT
- Not a chatbot toy
- Not prompt-only roleplay
- Not safety-through-censorship

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Optional: [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with a local model (e.g. `phi`)

## Run
```bash
python entelgia_unified.py

Philosophy

Entelgia emphasizes moral and conflict-based self-regulation
over external safety barriers.
