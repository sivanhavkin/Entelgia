# Contributing to Entelgia

I appreciate your interest in Entelgia.

Entelgia is a research-oriented, consciousness-inspired AI architecture.
Contributions are welcome — but they should respect the system’s core principles.

## What This Project Values

Before contributing, please understand that Entelgia prioritizes:

- Internal regulation through dialogue and conflict
- Persistent memory and identity continuity
- Reflection, correction, and moral tension over hard-coded rules
- Clarity of intent over technical cleverness

Contributions that improve performance **without preserving these principles**
may be declined.

## Ways to Contribute

You are welcome to contribute by:

- Reporting bugs or unexpected behaviors
- Suggesting architectural improvements
- Improving documentation or clarity
- Proposing experiments or research directions
- Refining prompts, observer logic, or memory dynamics
- Improving safety, transparency, or reproducibility

Small, focused contributions are preferred.

## Before Submitting a Pull Request

Please ensure that:

- Your change aligns with Entelgia’s conceptual goals
- Code is readable and intentionally written
- New behavior is explained (what changed and why)
- Experimental or speculative changes are clearly labeled

If you are unsure whether a change fits, open an issue first.

## Style & Philosophy

- Favor clarity over abstraction
- Avoid unnecessary frameworks or indirection
- Do not optimize away meaningful internal tension
- Do not remove observer or reflective mechanisms for simplicity

This is not a chatbot framework — it is an exploratory system.

---

## Ethics & Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow the Code of Conduct.

Entelgia is a human-centered research project.
Contributions that promote harm, abuse, or deceptive practices will not be accepted.

---

## Questions & Discussion

If you want to discuss ideas, philosophy, or experiments:
- Open an issue
- Or start a discussion thread

Curiosity is welcome. Certainty is not required.

Thank you for contributing to the evolution of Entelgia.
