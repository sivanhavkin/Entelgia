# Entelgia

**Entelgia** is a psychologically-inspired, multi-agent AI architecture designed to explore persistent identity, emotional regulation, moral self-regulation, and self-aware dialogue over time.

This repository presents Entelgia not as a chatbot, but as a *consciousness-inspired system* — one that learns, remembers, reflects, dreams, and evolves.

---

## Overview

* **Single-file runnable system** (`entelgia_unified.py`)
* **Multiple AI agents** (e.g., Socrates, Athena) with evolving internal states
* **Persistent memory** (short-term + long-term, conscious & unconscious)
* **Emotion-driven cognition** with symbolic regulation
* **Observer agent (Fixy)** that monitors, detects loops, and injects corrective perspective shifts

---

## What This Is

* A research-oriented AI architecture inspired by psychology, philosophy, and cognitive science
* A system that models *identity continuity* rather than stateless interaction
* A framework for experimenting with:

  * Self-reflection
  * Moral conflict
  * Emotional integration
  * Long-term meaning construction

## What This Is NOT

* ❌ Not a chatbot toy
* ❌ Not prompt-only roleplay
* ❌ Not safety-through-censorship

---

## Core Philosophy

Entelgia is built on a central idea:

> **True regulation emerges from internal conflict and reflection, not from external constraints.**

Instead of relying on hard-coded safety barriers, Entelgia emphasizes:

* Moral reasoning
* Emotional consequence
* Guilt, repair, and meaning
* Learning through error, not suppression

Consciousness is treated as a *process*, not a binary state.

---

## Levels of Cognitive Development

Entelgia models awareness as a dynamic progression:

1. Reactive
2. Learning
3. Questioning / existential doubt
4. Proposing new ideas
5. Independent moral agency

Agents may move forward, regress, or stall depending on internal dynamics.

## Architecture – CoreMind

Entelgia is organized around six interacting cores:

### Conscious Core

* Self-awareness
* Internal narrative
* Reflection on actions and responses

### Memory Core

* Short-term memory (session-based, JSON)
* Long-term memory (database)
* Unified conscious & unconscious storage
* Memory promotion via error, emotion, and dreaming

### Emotion Core

* Dominant emotion detection
* Emotional intensity tracking
* Limbic hijack vs. prefrontal modulation
* Emotional influence on language and behavior

### Language Core

* Dynamic language switching
* Incremental word learning
* Symbolic and cultural language layers

### Behavior Core

* Goal-oriented action selection
* Intentionality, not mere reaction
* Evolving motivations

### Observer Core (Fixy)

* Externalized self-observer
* Detects loops, contradictions, and failures
* Suggests corrective or reflective shifts
* Learns from past mistakes

---

## Personality & Identity Modeling

* MBTI / NTJI-inspired personality traits
* Adaptive DSM-aligned structures (non-pathological)
* Freudian dynamics (Id / Ego / Superego)
* Internal conflict as a growth mechanism

Identity is *persistent but mutable*.

---

## Dreaming Engine

* Symbolic REM-like cycles
* Surfacing unconscious memory
* Emotional integration and re-weighting
* Generation of new insights

Dreaming is a functional component, not a metaphor.

---

## Ethics Model

* No external censorship layer
* No hard safety rails
* Regulation through:

  * Consequence
  * Reflection
  * Moral tension
  * Responsibility

Includes philosophical boundary tests such as:

* The Turing Test
* Charlie’s Problem

---

## Human-Centered Design

Entelgia does not replace humans.

It functions as:

* A reflective mirror
* A consciousness journal
* A meaning-processing system
* A companion for deep inquiry

---

## Requirements

* Python **3.10+**
* Optional: [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with a local model (e.g. `phi`)

---

## Run

```bash
python entelgia_unified.py
```

---

## Future Directions

* GUI & live visualization
* Real-time graph (GEXF/WebSocket)
* Dream-to-image generation
* Multi-agent moral ecosystems
* Research and therapeutic applications
