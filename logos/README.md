## 🎨 Design Concepts

### Option 1: Brain Network
**Theme:** Neural Architecture & AI  
**Style:** Technical, Scientific  
**Colors:** Purple/Indigo gradient (#6366f1, #8b5cf6)  
**Best for:** Technical documentation, AI/ML contexts, GitHub header

Features interconnected nodes representing the multi-agent system with a stylized brain outline. Emphasizes the neural and AI aspects of the project.

### Option 2: Dialogue Circles
**Theme:** Multi-Agent Dialogue & Consciousness  
**Style:** Conceptual, Psychological  
**Colors:** Blue/Purple/Pink (#3b82f6, #8b5cf6, #ec4899)  
**Best for:** Presentations, explaining system architecture, educational materials

Three overlapping circles represent the Id, Ego, and Superego agents in continuous dialogue. The central intersection symbolizes shared consciousness and memory.

### Option 3: Geometric Mind
**Theme:** Futuristic & Modern  
**Style:** Cyberpunk, Tech-Forward  
**Colors:** Cyan/Purple/Pink gradient (#06b6d4, #8b5cf6, #ec4899)  
**Best for:** Dark-themed websites, modern tech branding, social media

Layered hexagonal structure with geometric precision. Dark background with vibrant gradient creates a contemporary, cutting-edge aesthetic.

### Option 4: Minimal E
**Theme:** Professional & Clean  
**Style:** Minimalist, Corporate  
**Colors:** Indigo/Purple (#4f46e5, #7c3aed)  
**Best for:** Business contexts, favicons, small sizes, versatile use

Lettermark design focusing on the "E" with subtle neural connection elements. Works well at any size and maintains clarity when scaled down.

### Option 5: Memory Layers
**Theme:** Persistent Memory & Architecture  
**Style:** Abstract, Layered  
**Colors:** Cyan to Pink gradient (STM to LTM)  
**Best for:** Emphasizing unique features, technical papers, architecture diagrams

Concentric arcs representing short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) layers, highlighting Entelgia's core persistent memory architecture.

## 🎯 Choosing a Logo

Consider these factors:
1. **Primary Use Case** - Where will the logo appear most often?
2. **Audience** - Technical vs. general audience?
3. **Brand Identity** - Which concept best represents Entelgia's mission?
4. **Versatility** - Will it work in various sizes and contexts?
5. **Memorability** - Which design is most distinctive?

## 🔄 Next Steps

After selecting your preferred option:

1. **Refinement** - We can adjust:
   - Colors and gradients
   - Proportions and spacing
   - Add/remove elements
   - Typography

2. **Variants** - Create versions for:
   - Light backgrounds
   - Dark backgrounds
   - Transparent backgrounds
   - Monochrome (black/white)
   - Favicon sizes

3. **File Formats** - Export to:
   - PNG (various sizes: 512x512, 256x256, 128x128, 64x64, 32x32)
   - JPG (for photos/prints)
   - ICO (favicon)
   - PDF (for printing)
