## Roadmap (next step)

The next stage of Entelgia focuses on memory transitions and internal processing over time.

Memory is structured into three layers:
- Short-term memory
- Unconscious memory
- Conscious memory

Transitions from short-term memory to conscious awareness are not automatic.
Only experiences with sufficient **meaning**, **attention**, or **emotional tension** are allowed to enter consciousness.

Experiences that do not reach conscious awareness are not discarded.
Instead, they move into the unconscious layer, where they continue to influence behavior indirectly.

In addition, a **dreaming state** is introduced.
During dreaming, content can transition from the unconscious into conscious awareness through associative and non-rational pathways.

Dreaming is not meant to resolve conflicts, but to allow reprocessing, resurfacing, and recontextualization of unresolved internal material.

The goal is to explore how internal regulation and moral constraints can emerge from lived history and internal dynamics, rather than from rigid external rules.
