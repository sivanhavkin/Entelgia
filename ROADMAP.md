# Entelgia Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the evolving direction of the Entelgia project.
It represents exploration goals rather than fixed delivery promises.

---

## Current Stage — v2.x (Experimental Dialogue Architecture)

- Multi-agent dialogue system
- Persistent memory integration
- Observer-based regulation (Fixy)
- Structured dialogue strategies
- Local-first execution via Ollama

Focus: stability, clarity, and architectural refinement.

---

## Near-Term Goals

- Improve dialogue coherence across long sessions
- Memory relevance tuning
- Observer intervention heuristics
- Simplified installation experience
- Expanded example dialogues

---

## Mid-Term Exploration

- Visualisation of dialogue dynamics
- Behavioural pattern tracking
- Agent state introspection tools
- Modular component separation
- Research-oriented evaluation metrics

---

## Long-Term Research Direction

- Dialogue-governed behavioural models
- Internal conflict simulation
- Emergent regulation mechanisms
- Alternative AI architecture patterns beyond stateless prompting

---

## Philosophy

Entelgia evolves through experimentation and iteration.
The roadmap reflects exploration rather than a fixed product plan.
