Entelgia is an experimental, research-oriented AI system.
Security is approached as a design concern, not a claim of complete protection.

---

## Scope

This project explores persistent memory, internal dialogue, and self-regulation
in AI systems. As such:

- Unexpected behaviors may occur
- Meta-instructions or internal artifacts may surface
- The system should not be used in safety-critical or adversarial environments

---

## Reporting a Security Concern

If you discover a security issue, privacy risk, or unintended behavior:

- Please do **not** open a public issue immediately
- Contact the maintainer directly:

📧 **[your email here]**

Provide:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Any relevant logs or context

Responsible disclosure is appreciated.

---

## Data & Privacy Notes

- Entelgia stores memory locally on the user's machine
- No data is transmitted externally except to the configured local LLM runtime
- Memory can be manually deleted by removing local data files (see README)

Users are responsible for reviewing and managing their local data.

---

## Experimental Nature

This project is under active research and development.
Security mechanisms may change as the architecture evolves.

There is no guarantee of protection against all misuse or failure modes.

Thank you for helping improve Entelgia responsibly.
